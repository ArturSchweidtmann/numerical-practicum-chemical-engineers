    "Our goal is to solve the Poisson-Boltzman equation numerically. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to go throught the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. spatial discretization of the linear diffusion operator using second order central finite differences on uniform meshes in 1D and 2D subject to various boundary conditions; \n",
    "2. spatial discretization of the non-linear reaction terms by collocation;\n",
    "3. linearization by computating exact Jacobians (or otherwise);\n",
    "4. root finding using Newton-type method with accuracy imposed by tolerances (or use-time integration to resolve the non-linearity);\n",
    "\n",
    "Domenico expects that the introduction of automatic differentiation to compute the Jacobian is likely to simplify the overall solution procedure and unlock new simulation possibilities. "

For simplified cases, analytical solutions seem to be available (Ref 15 and Ref 16 on the wiki page [wiki on the Poisson-Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson–Boltzmann_equation)). These analytical solutions provide a reference for the numerical computations. Possibly the analytical solutions can be generated using symbolic computations using the sympy.dsolve() function with the bcs option to specify the boundary condtions. "

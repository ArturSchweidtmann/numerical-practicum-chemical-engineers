## Section 2/: Course Overview 

### Section 1.2/: Course Information 
- 6 ECTS in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 - 2023; 
- 4 hours per week; 
- more supervision/help/support in Q1; less so in Q2; 

### Section 2.2/: Constructive Alignment for the Course 

#### Study goals: 
Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation techniques are indispensable to address challenges in chemical engineering. These challenges include the combustion of hydro-carbon fuels in industry, irrigation in sustainable agriculture and the deployment of new instruments and materials in medicine. This course builds on two pilars. The first pilar encompasses tools related to solving partial differential equations numerically. These tools include methods for solving ordinary differential equations, non-linear and linear systems. The second pilar encompasses tools used to extract meaningful information from large collections of data. This data includes sound, image and video recordings resulting from either numerical simulations or experimental campaigns. Tools for data handling include methods for computing integrals, derivatives, trends, compression and frequency content. This course is subdivided into three compartments. In the first and second compartment, the first and second pilar are discussed seperately. The third compartment, the two pillars are combined using methods from calibration, optimization and assimilation to arrive at predictive models in advanced chemical engineering applications. 

#### Learning activities: 
The course divides the learning activities in three consequitive steps; 1/ allow students to work in group (or individually) on the assignments; 2/ facillitate in-classroom discussion/feedback/peer-review on the assignment (how to ask for feedback in such away that more reserved students are genuinely heard?); 3/ give lectures on-demand to after receiving input on the assignments; 

#### Formative assessment: 
20 percent of the grade on each of the six homework assignments; give 10 percent of the grade for free; take 10 percent of the grade back in case of poor participation (absence, obstructive behavior) in the course; reward above average participation in the course (giving lectures, moderating group discussions, tutoring fellow students, sharing sample code, seeking and sharing documentation, providing alternative pointers or examples) by adding 10 percent of the grade; 

#### Summative assessment: 
80 percent of the grade on each of the six homework assignments; completion of the assignment;  individual grade on first homework assignment; grade used as input for group formation; assessment per group of four (4) students for last five assignments; group grade on the last five homework assignments;

[Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO6cz8ss=/?share_link_id=69985717280)

### Section 4.2/: Other arrangements to be made

- establish house rules for the course;
- establish Q&A for the course;
- Vocareum for auto-grading of the assignments;

### Section 5.2/: Asked Jolanda Quak to arrange 

#### Prior to the summer 2022  
1. notify TG that a book is no longer required; course will link to online resources instead; 
2. notify Osiris of wish to register two grades. The first (to two) grades is an intermediate grade (after 3 assignments at the end of Q1). The second (of two) grades is the final grade (after 6 assignments at the end of Q2). The first grade only serves for teaching staff to keep track of active participation in the course (thanks to Arno Hakket for providing this suggestion); 
3. notify campus-wide BrightSpace support about need for course pages and plug-in for Vocareum (see below);  

#### During summer 2022 
1. notify non-TU-Delft bachelor students about Python introduction to the course (see below); 

#### Introduction Days end of August 2022 
1. notify all students to enroll in course via BrightSpace; 
2. instruct students on how to navigate to Vocareum and Jupiter notebook for Python through Vocareum;  

### Section 6.2/: Teaching Support and BrightSpace Pages
Beste Domenico,

Mijn collega's hebben het aanvragen van een nieuwe course, CH3133, voor volgend jaar via een TOPdesk call in gang gezet, echter vernamen wij van de Faculty Mandate dat dit vak in Osiris staat voor volgend jaar en dus automatisch aangemaakt zal worden. Als dit het geval is dan kunnen wij geen nieuwe course aanvragen, deze zou namelijk alleen maar verwarring opleveren wanneer er automatisch vanuit Osiris nieuwe courses worden aangemaakt voor volgend jaar, dan zou de course dubbel bestaan.

Om toegang te krijgen tot de course voor volgend jaar zult u dus Early Access moeten aanvragen, dit kan helaas pas vanaf 1 Juni. Wilt u wel al beginnen met het klaarzetten of uittesten van enkele dingen voor de cursus van volgend jaar dan raden wij u aan om een Sandbox te gebruiken. Als u nog geen Sandbox heeft kunt u deze bij ons aanvragen en als u wel een Sandbox heeft kunnen wij deze op uw verzoek re-setten.

Ik zal dus de lopende TOPdesk calls sluiten.

Excuses voor het ongemak,
Vriendelijke groet,
Willem Kerstjens

## Section 3/: Software Instruments (needs revision)  

### Section 1.3/: Python 

#### Students should use Python and Jupyter notebook via Vocareum. 

Divide students in the following three groups: TU bachelor, entirely strange to Python and in between group. Define seperate tasks for the three groups. 

Introduction in Python programming in four parts. Used as reference for future parts of the course. (Encourage TU Delft bachelor students to give Part 4/4 a look?, how to provide opportunity to practice, how do other courses do so?)
1. [Part 1/4](intro-python/notebooks/ANM_2020_PythonIntro1.ipynb): introduction; operations of vectors and matrices; plotting; 
2. [Part 2/4](intro-python/notebooks/ANM_2020_PythonIntro2.ipynb): functions, particular matrices, matrix-vector operations, linear Systems and more plotting;
3. [Part 3/4](intro-python/notebooks/ANM_2020_PythonIntro3.ipynb): conditional statements, loops, vectorization and function handles; 
4. [Part 4/4](intro-python/notebooks/ANM_2020_PythonIntro4.ipynb): non-linear systems, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data and optimization

#### Doubts on the use of Python in Computational Practicum for non-math/non-computer science master students 
1. Python + Numpy (patches deficiencies of Python) + Scipy (patches deficiencies of Numpy) creates confusion. Replace by Julia instead.  
2. When/how (in case at all) to raise awareness on how to code to obtain computational efficiency? How to discuss avoiding loops? How to vectorize code? What are good examples/practices/tools? What are pitfalls to avoid? How to explain the need for Numpy and Scipy (written in C++) for large scale scientific computing?  
3. When/how (in case at all) to address the two language problem, i.e., the fact that the bulk of the computations does not happen in Python, but rather in Fortran or C? (Examples are linear algebra, time stepping and FFT among many others). Do we teach Python initially to reveal the need to switch to non-Python later?   
4. When/how (in case at all) to address software development practises? When to introduce object-oriented programming?
5. When/how (in case at all) to address parallel computing architectures and/or large data sets?

### Section 2.3/: Numpy (can we find a good tutorial?)  
1. High level overview: replace Python lists by Numpy vectors, matrices and operations on these objects. 
2. NumPy uses C-order indexing. That means that the last index usually represents the most rapidly changing memory location, unlike Fortran, where the first index represents the most rapidly changing location in memory. This difference represents a great potential for confusion.
3. NumPy uses particular rules for broadcasting. Some documentation is [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.broadcast.html?highlight=broadcast#numpy.broadcast); more documentation is required;
4. Numpy documentation hard to read. From the very start, users are confronted with other programming languages;

## Section 14/:  Industrial Assignments in Collaboration with CelSian BV Eindhoven 

### First Assignment: Partial Differential Equations Models for Heat Transfer in Furnaces 

- heat transfer in air by diffusion; heat transfer in air/lining by diffusion (first test to implement variable diffusion failed); non-linear diffusion is lining; add convection in air; add radiative heat transfer in the air; 
- heat transfer in molten glass; thermal conductivity and density are temperature dependent leading to a non-linear problem; 
- one and two spatial dimensions; 
- finite difference method on uniform meshes; 
- implementation in Python using [py-pde library](https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html);  
- TU Delft takes the lead; 

### Second Assignment: Handling Lab Experimental Data to Estimate Thermo-Physical Properties of Molten Glass 

- in production on glass, formation of bubbles of air in the molten glass forms a challenges. The modeling of  the formation of these bubbles requires a good estimate of the diffusion coefficient of species. These diffusion coefficients are typically known up to a high degree of uncertainty. Celsian therefore carries out lab test to be able to infer estimates of the diffusion coefficients from measurements;   
- Gibs free energy mimization; an example of Gibbs free energy minimizer is [volpatto/gibbs](https://github.com/volpatto/gibbs). Requires equation of state (parameters to estimate, pressure and temperature dependence) and experimental data; a hierarchy of models would be nice to have here;  
- Celsian takes the lead; 

### Third Assignment: Optimal Design / Operation  Heat Transfer in Furnaces   

- Zonal Models - Reduced order models - Specified desired objective - Formulate and solve optimization problem; 
- TU Delft takes the lead;

### Organization issues 

Assignments will be deployed to students in November 2022;

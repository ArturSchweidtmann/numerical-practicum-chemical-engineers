## Section 2/: Course Overview 

### In general 

- formative assessment during the course: to be defined; 
- summative assessment: via 6 homework assignments - no written exam any more - how to define retake? 

### Common to all Homework Assignments 

- Six assignments in total - 1 ECTS per assignment - 28 hours of work for students  
- in Q1: three compulsory assignments (no freedom of choice)
- in Q2: possibly elective assignments (choice assignment corresponding to course)

### Software installation for the course

- how to ensure that students do not encounter issues with software installation?  
- python and object oriented programming;
- python and the two language problem; 

### Other arrangements to be made

- establish house rules for the course;
- establish Q&A for the course;

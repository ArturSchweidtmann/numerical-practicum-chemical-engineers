    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to solve reaction-diffusion systems. We will use the Brusselator model as an example. Many other examples of similar models, however, do exist. The Brusselator model is a model for two species that can be formulated in three ways. First, as a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations. Secondly as a systems of two coupled partial differential equations in one dimension (x). And finally as a systems of two coupled partial differential equations in two dimensions (x and y). Examples of an implementations include [as ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brusselator) and as PDE in two dimensions [in Python using py-pde](https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_gallery/pde_brusselator_expression.html) and  [in Julia using DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/).  We expect to recover Turing patterns in the numerical solution as shown on the above wiki page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to reproduce the above examples, understand the implementation, understand the numerical solution obtained and extend the Brusselator model to other examples (variation of the same homework assignment). \n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant component of ANM-2021 include the spatial discretization of the 1D and 2D diffusion equation, the linearization of the non-linear terms and the implicit methods for time integration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to go through the following stages: \n",
    "1. spatial discretization of the linear diffusion operator using second order central finite differences on uniform meshes in 1D and 2D subject to various boundary conditions; \n",
    "2. spatial discretization of the non-linear reaction terms by collocation;\n",
    "3. linearization by computating exact Jacobians (or otherwise);\n",
    "4. implicit time integration using a variable time step set by imposing the accuracy of the time integration (settings for atol and rtol);"
